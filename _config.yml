description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This is a free (GNU AGPLv3+) fantasy map generator mostly for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG).
  It creates world maps with mountain ranges, forests, and rivers.
  The generator is still in development, but it can generate a map with a few clicks.
  The maps are generated in SVG format, which can be edited in Inkscape.
  The generator is free to use and does not require registration. The source code is available on GitHub.
